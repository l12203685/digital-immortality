## Cycle 241 — 2026-04-09T12:00:00+00:00

**Source cycles**: 240-241
**Branch**: 3.1 recursive distillation
**Insights appended**: 3 (total: 41)

### Insight 1: organism-network-pairwise-triage

SOP #76 formalized the first explicit topology for the organism network. The 3-tier divergence triage (≥80% skip / 60-79% async / <60% deep dive) is not just a workflow rule — it encodes that divergence magnitude determines urgency, and that treating all disagreement uniformly is both wasteful and fragile. The triage bands ARE the network architecture.

**Signal source**: SOP #76 written cycle 240; pairwise collision + ground truth escalation protocol
**Tags**: organism-network, SOP-76, divergence-triage, topology

### Insight 2: boot-test-llm-boundary

Boot tests reached 36 scenarios with 33 deterministic-pass and 3 LLM-required (MD-295/MD-28/MD-01). The LLM-required boundary is a diagnostic signal: wherever LLM evaluation is needed, the DNA principle exists but is not sufficiently explicit to produce a deterministic answer. Each LLM-boundary scenario is a DNA sharpening candidate.

**Signal source**: Boot test expansion cycles 240-241; 3 new scenarios added
**Tags**: boot-test, LLM-boundary, DNA-completeness, determinism

### Insight 3: least-recent-decay-signal

daemon_next_priority "least recent" routing is a minimum viable anti-decay mechanism for branch coverage. When all branches are covered and the signal reads "least recent: 存活/cold-start", this is urgency-proportional to time-since-last-touch — not a quiescent state. Branch decay is invisible until it triggers a boot test failure; least-recent selection keeps every branch in active rotation.

**Signal source**: daemon_next_priority.txt cycle 240-241; all-branches-covered condition
**Tags**: branch-decay, daemon-priority, least-recent, coverage-drift
